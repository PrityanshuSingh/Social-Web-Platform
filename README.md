# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


## Getting Started
This repository contains a React project set up with Vite for fast development and HMR (Hot Module Replacement).
To get a local copy of the project up and running, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your local machine.

- Node.js: [Download here](https://nodejs.org/)
- npm: This comes bundled with Node.js

### Run the following commands in your vscode terminal
1. git clone -b <repository-url>
2. cd <project-directory>
3. npm install
4. npm run dev

This will start the development server using Vite, and you can view the React application in your web browser at the specified localhost address (usually http://localhost:3000).
